            <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and olive oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup heavy cream, divided</li>

            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Roughly quarter the onion half, and separate the pieces. Place onion pieces on a baking tray. 
                Open the can of diced tomatoes. Carefully drizzle some of the liquid onto the onion.</li>
            <li>Roast onions in the preheated oven until soft, about 25 minutes. 
                Place onions and tomatoes in a high-powered blender, such as a Vitamix. Cover tightly and blend on high for 40 seconds.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. 
                Carefully pour in the tomato mixture, and cook, stirring occasionally until hot, about 3 minutes. Stir in 3 tablespoons cream.</li>
            <li>Ladle soup into bowls, and drizzle remaining cream over each serving.</li>

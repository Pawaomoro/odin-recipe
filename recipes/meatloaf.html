        <h2>Steps.</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine ground beef, salt, pepper, cayenne, green onions, parsley, bread crumbs, egg, and Worcestershire sauce in a large bowl</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with a silicone liner </li>
            <li>Remove meat from the refrigerator and divide into 8 equal portions. Dampen your fingers with cold water and roll meat into smooth balls</li>
            <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until cooked through, about 20 minutes</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and immediately place a slice of provolone cheese on the top of each ghost, centering it the best you can. <br> Cut the remaining 2 slices of provolone into quarters and place those over the center to provide more cheese for the head.</li>
            <li>Return to the oven until the cheese melts, 30 to 60 seconds.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and take some of the melted cheese around the bottoms and wrap and drape it back up over the heads.</li>
            <li>Combine ketchup, barbecue sauce, and Sriracha for blood sauce; ladle onto plates and serve meatloaf ghosts on top</li>
        </ol>
